To-Do List Web App Overview
1. Introduction:
* The To-Do List Web App is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks in an organized manner.
2. Key Components:
* HTML (index.html):
    * Sets up the structure of the web page with input fields and a list to display tasks.
    * Links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for functionality.
* CSS (styles.css):
    * Defines the visual style of the To-Do List, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.
    * Uses flexbox for layout and includes styles for input fields, buttons, and task items.
* JavaScript (script.js):
    * Provides dynamic functionality for adding tasks and deleting tasks.
    * Ensures user input validation for adding tasks.
    * Implements a simple mechanism to delete tasks from the list.
3. Functionality:
* Adding Tasks:
    * Users can input a task in the text field and click the "Add Task" button.
    * The JavaScript function addTask checks for valid input and appends a new task to the list.
* Deleting Tasks:
    * Each task item includes a "Delete" button.
    * Clicking the "Delete" button triggers the deleteTask function, removing the associated task.
4. User Interaction:
* Input Validation:
    * The app checks if the task input is empty and alerts the user if they attempt to add an empty task.
* Visual Feedback:
    * Buttons change color on hover, providing visual feedback to users.
5. Expandability:
* Task Completion Status:
    * You can expand the app to include a task completion status (e.g., marking tasks as done).
* Due Dates:
    * Enhance the app by allowing users to set due dates for tasks.
* Local Storage:
    * Implement local storage to persist tasks even when the user refreshes the page.
6. Conclusion:
* The To-Do List Web App serves as a fundamental project for learning web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* It provides a foundation for more advanced features and improvements.
